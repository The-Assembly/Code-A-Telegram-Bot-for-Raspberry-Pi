# Code-A-Telegram-Bot-for-Raspberry-Pi
The Raspberry Pi is a very handy item of hardware that can be put to many uses, as we’ve seen in past workshops. This $35 single-board computer can easily stand in for desktops and laptops in projects that need compactness and ease of use, unobtrusively giving us computing power for an array of functionality, further augmented through auxiliary modules.  In this workshop, we’ll take the convenience afforded by the Pi to the next level by building a bot within the extremely popular Telegram cloud messaging app to automate a variety of common tasks for the Pi, including controlling the camera module remotely, accessing media, and operating various actuators/sensors from the comfort of the app.  Prerequisites: - Raspberry Pi (with Raspbian OS) - Relays, jumper cables, servos/buzzers/LEDs - Pi Camera module (optional)  -----------------------------------------  To learn more about The Assembly’s workshops, visit our website, social media or email us at workshops@theassembly.ae  Our website: http://theassembly.ae Follow us on social media: —Instagram: http://instagram.com/makesmartthings —Facebook: http://fb.com/makesmartthings —Twitter: http://twitter.com/makesmartthings  #RaspberryPi #Telegram #EmbeddedSystems #DIY #HomeAutomation
